# P2-RevImburseApp
Coding Engineers: Aimen Altaiyeb, Dave Perugini, Tareeq Hamilton, Gloria Johnston

Project One was a reimbursement app that allowed an employee to submit a reimbursement
request, that a manager can then either accept or reject.

Project Two adds to Project One the function of viewing a receipt image for both the employee and the
manager. The manager can view all requests and all employees. The employee can view all requests made
(all pending, all approved, and all rejected).
